12592425 is the "Operating System ID" of the last iteration of software used in 2004 Corvettes.

AFter I started this project I realized than the 12587603 operating system is a much better candidate for adding new features, because it is available with a wider variety of transmission types and throttle types. You can find resources for disassembling that OS here: https://github.com/LegacyNsfw/12587603

The main thing here is the sanitized IDC script, which can be loaded into IDA Pro to annotate your own disassembly with everything I've found so far. But, seriously, you should just flash the 12587603 OS to your PCM and continue with that one instead.
